AB  - A detailed examination of the 1930 Lanarkshire Milk Experiment (LME) by the 
      famous statistician William Sealy Gossett ("Student"), which appeared in 
      Biometrika in 1931, is re-examined from a more modern perspective. The LME had a 
      complicated design whereby 67 schools in Lanarkshire were allocated to receive 
      either raw or pasteurised milk but pupils within the schools were allocated to 
      either receive milk or to act as controls. Student's criticisms are considered in 
      detail and examined in terms of subsequent developments on the design and 
      analysis of experiments, in particular as regards appropriate estimation of 
      standard errors of treatment estimates when an incomplete blocks structure has 
      been used. An analogy with a more modern trial in osteoarthritis is made. 
      Suggestions are made as to how analysis might proceed if the original data were 
      available. Some lessons for observational studies in epidemiology are drawn and 
      it is speculated that hidden clustering structures might be an explanation as to 
      why results may vary from observational study to observational study by more than 
      conventionally calculated standard errors might suggest.

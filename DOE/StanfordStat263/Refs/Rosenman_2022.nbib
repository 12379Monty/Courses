AB  - We consider how to merge a limited amount of data from a randomized controlled 
      trial (RCT) into a much larger set of data from an observational data base (ODB), 
      to estimate an average causal treatment effect. Our methods are based on 
      stratification. The strata are defined in terms of effect moderators as well as 
      propensity scores estimated in the ODB. Data from the RCT are placed into the 
      strata they would have occupied, had they been in the ODB instead. We assume that 
      treatment differences are comparable in the two data sources. Our first 
      "spiked-in" method simply inserts the RCT data into their corresponding ODB 
      strata. We also consider a data-driven convex combination of the ODB and RCT 
      treatment effect estimates within each stratum. Using the delta method and 
      simulations, we identify a bias problem with the spiked-in estimator that is 
      ameliorated by the convex combination estimator. We apply our methods to data 
      from the Women's Health Initiative, a study of thousands of postmenopausal women 
      which has both observational and experimental data on hormone therapy (HT). Using 
      half of the RCT to define a gold standard, we find that a version of the 
      spiked-in estimator yields lower-MSE estimates of the causal impact of HT on 
      coronary heart disease than would be achieved using either a small RCT or the 
      observational component on its own.
